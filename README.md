# dateparser #

Welcome to dateparser!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JamesSullivan/dateparser.png)](https://travis-ci.org/JamesSullivan/dateparser)

A simple English language explicit date parser. This parser only supports parsing of complete explicit dates from 1901 to 2099. Dates without the century (two digit years) default to 20th century if greater than or equal to 50 or to the 21st century if less than. Although most date formats are clear, certain date formats can be ambiguous and the locale must be set or else by default priority will be given to US date format interpretations.

It does not parse time (9:00), relaxed dates (Oct 1st without the year), relative dates (the day before next Thursday), or date alternatives (next Mon or Tuesday). If you have those or similar requirements I recommend trying [Natty](http://natty.joestelmach.com/) or [datr.scala](https://github.com/platzhaltr/datr.scala).


## You may want to use this date parser if you need to...
* keep false positives to a minimum.

* be able to handle ambiguous English date formats of different regions. [Date format by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country)

* easily modify the code yourself to handle special cases (the code is only around a page long)


## Usage

Add the following dependency to build.sbt

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq ("com.lihaoyi" %% "fastparse" % "2.3.3")
```

and add the src/main/scala/asia/solutions/dateparser/EnglishParser.scala file to your source code

```scala
import asia.solutions.dateparser._

val parser = new EnglishParser()
val dateResults: Seq[DateResult] = parser.dateResults("the date of Sept. 10, 1992, unless otherwise noted")

for (dr <- dateResults) {
    println("LocalDate: " + dr.localDate)
    // LocalDate: 1992-09-10

    println("Date text: " + dr.dateRawText)
    // Date text: Sept. 10, 1992

    println("Date text starts at character position: " + dr.index)
    // Date text starts at character position: 26
}
```

See the examples in the [EnglishParserSpec.scala](https://github.com/JamesSullivan/dateparser/blob/master/src/test/scala/asia/solutions/dateparser/EnglishParserSpec.scala) test file for examples on additional functionality

## Unsupported by default but easily enabled 
The following formats can lead to false positives so they must be specifically enabled by changing 

**22.04.96**  rare in English -- to support change line 123 to     val Divider = ("/" | "-" | ".") 

**04062005**  to naively support change line 123 to  val Divider = ("/" | "-").? 

a better change is to add a specific parser
